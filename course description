                            " <p>Dive right into the real world of building world-changing products, by \
                            developing the version of the popular web tool, Twitter, from the ground up. \
                            </p>\

                            <p>This version of Twitter was so successful, it is now one of the top 10 most used sites in the world.</p> \

                            <p>This hands-on workshop will give students familiarity with "rapid prototyping" concepts, which are most concerned \
                            with how to launch quickly, efficiently, and effectively. We will explore topics such as web tools, visual design, \
                            managing data in the cloud, creating user engagement and interactivity through animations and javascript, customizing \
                            user experiences, and keeping your application data safe.</p> \

                            <strong> Experience Coding is Not Required </strong> - All levels are welcome! \

                            <p>This course is not concerned with the fundamentals of computer science and having a career as a developer for a medium \
                            to large company. Instead, the focus is on giving students the tools to launch web products of their own, as well as sparking \
                            curiosity on what they can do with current technology. This is a play-based course, designed to hone tinkering and exploration \
                            habits, by giving students practice building useful tools that they can show off to friends and family.</p> \
